# BMI Calculator

BMI Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The BMI Calculator project is a web application designed to calculate and display Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-entered weight and height. It utilizes fundamental web technologies including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Cod explination and Functionality

### HTML (index.html):

Serves as the foundational structure of the web page, containing necessary elements for user interaction.
Includes a form where users can input their weight and height separately.
Features a "Calculate BMI" button that triggers a JavaScript function to compute and display the BMI result.

### CSS (styles.css):

Styles the visual appearance of the page to enhance user experience.
Defines fonts, colors, margins, and padding to improve the overall look and feel of the application.
Ensures responsiveness and usability across different devices through media queries and layout adjustments.

### JavaScript (script.js):

Provides interactive functionality, notably through the calculateBMI() function.
CalculateBMI() retrieves user-input weight and height values from HTML, computes BMI using the standard formula (weight / height^2), and determines the BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, extremely obese).
Displays the corresponding BMI category message in a dedicated HTML <div>
